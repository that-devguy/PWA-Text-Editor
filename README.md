*Just Another Text Editor* that meets the PWA criteria! This application is a single-page app that features a number of persistant data techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. *J.A.T.E.* will also function offline by implementing methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database.
